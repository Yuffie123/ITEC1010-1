Hello! My name is Hengjun Ji.   I am studying Commerce – Accounting at York University in Toronto. Apart from that, I am passionate about data-driven decision making and data analysis.
Nowadays, I am learning Excel and Python for business data analysis. Excel is commonly used by accountants in their daily work, while Python is more efficient for fetching and analyzing large datasets. When analyzing weather data in Toronto, I found that Python was especially useful for retrieving relevant data and automating the analysis process. On the other hand, Excel is more beginner-friendly and works well for basic analysis and data visualization. One of the projects I’ve completed involved analyzing and visualizing 14 days of weather data in Toronto using both Excel and Python. 
In addition to my studies, I have an interest in photography and HTML. I'm currently exploring HTML and using it to design my personal website.
